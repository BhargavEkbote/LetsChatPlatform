# LetsChatPlatform
LetsChat is a base on which a social media platform can be built.

# Steps to implement:
1. Replace the current backend server with your own.
2. This is made to be as customisable and easy to tweak as it can be, so tweak all you want.

Goals:
Add more features that most other platforms already have so that when forking, those features do not take any extra time to add.
